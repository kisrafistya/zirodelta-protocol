# ZiroDelta Protocol - Security Audit Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the findings of a security audit of the ZiroDelta Protocol smart contracts. The audit was conducted to identify potential vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for improvement. The audit focused on the following areas:

- Smart Contract Vulnerabilities
- Economic Model Security
- Multi-Chain Security

## 2. Findings

### 2.1. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities

#### 2.1.1. Reentrancy

**Severity:** High

**Status:** Mitigated

The contracts use the `nonReentrant` modifier from OpenZeppelin to protect against reentrancy attacks. This is a standard and effective mitigation.

#### 2.1.2. Integer Overflow

**Severity:** Medium

**Status:** Mitigated

The contracts use Solidity version 0.8.20, which has built-in protection against integer overflow. This is a sufficient mitigation.

#### 2.1.3. Access Control

**Severity:** Low

**Status:** Mitigated

The contracts use a combination of `Ownable` and `AccessControl` to manage permissions. The use of `AccessControl` in the `ZiroDeltaEmergency` contract is a good practice, as it provides a more flexible and secure way to manage permissions. It is recommended to use `AccessControl` in all contracts that require permission management.

### 2.2. Economic Model Security

#### 2.2.1. Oracle Manipulation

**Severity:** High

**Status:** Partially Mitigated

The protocol relies on a single oracle to provide funding rate data. This is a single point of failure and could be a target for manipulation. To further mitigate this risk, it is recommended to use multiple oracle providers and a time-weighted average price (TWAP) to validate the data.

#### 2.2.2. Flash Loan Attacks

**Severity:** Medium

**Status:** Not Mitigated

The AMM contract could be vulnerable to flash loan attacks. An attacker could use a flash loan to manipulate the price of the tokens and then profit from the arbitrage opportunity. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to use a TWAP oracle for pricing.

### 2.3. Multi-Chain Security

**Severity:** High

**Status:** Not Mitigated

The protocol does not currently have any cross-chain functionality. If cross-chain functionality is added in the future, it will be important to conduct a thorough security review of the bridge and the cross-chain communication mechanism.

## 3. Recommendations

- Implement multiple oracle providers and a TWAP to validate the data.
- Use a TWAP oracle for pricing in the AMM to mitigate the risk of flash loan attacks.
- If cross-chain functionality is added in the future, conduct a thorough security review of the bridge and the cross-chain communication mechanism.
- Use `AccessControl` in all contracts that require permission management.
